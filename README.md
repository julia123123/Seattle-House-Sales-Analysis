This project downloads the clean King County, Washington State, housing price data set from Kaggle and creates different charts.
Users can choose to use different variables to control the chart on the right in the FILTERS field on the left.
Different years and times are used, and in the chart on the right you can see the distribution of Bedrooms, Bathroom, House Prices, View and heat, and the House Sales Price.
When Filters selects Yr Built, Sqft Lot, Sqft Living, you can control the results of the four charts below on the right.
